-   [x] Implement a basic UI for user and group management
-   [x] Add a UI for configuring SSO connections (OIDC & SAML)
-   [x] Add a UI for managing SCIM connectors

## Phase 3: Identity Governance & Administration (IGA)

### 3.1. Access Requests

-   [x] Design and implement a workflow for access requests
-   [x] Create APIs for submitting and approving access requests
-   [x] Integrate with the provisioning service to automate fulfillment

### 3.2. Certification Campaigns

-   [x] Design and implement a system for creating and managing certification campaigns
-   [x] Create APIs for campaign creation, scheduling, and review
-   [x] Develop a UI for reviewers to approve or revoke access

### 3.3. RBAC & Policy

-   [x] Implement a role management system (CRUD for roles)
-   [x] Associate permissions with roles
-   [x] Integrate a policy engine (e.g., OPA) for fine-grained authorization
-   [x] Create a UI for managing roles and policies

### 3.4. Audit & Reporting

-   [x] Create an immutable audit trail for all events

# Identity & Governance Platform — Implementation-ready Spec

> Comprehensive, implementation-ready outline for an enterprise Identity & Governance Platform (I&GP). Use this as your canonical spec when you begin design, development, operations, and compliance work.

---

## Executive summary

Goal: Build an enterprise-grade Zero Trust Identity & Governance Platform providing SSO (OIDC/SAML), identity lifecycle & directory, provisioning (SCIM/connectors), policy-driven authorization, identity governance (attestations, role mining), and full audit/compliance capabilities. Focus on chosen differentiators (operability, governance, privacy, or developer experience).

Target customers: Enterprise IT, security teams, SaaS platform developers, MSPs.

Success criteria:
- Reliable token issuance at scale and low latency.
- Accurate provisioning between authoritative sources and downstream systems.
- Auditability and compliance evidence (SOC2/GDPR).
- Developer-friendly APIs/SDKs and low ops surface for administrators.

## 5. Data model (canonical entities)

Suggested Postgres tables (simplified):

- identities
  - id (uuid), tenant_id, status, created_at, updated_at, attributes JSONB

- accounts
  - id, identity_id, login, credential_meta JSONB, last_login

- groups
  - id, tenant_id, name, members JSONB (or join table), metadata

- roles
  - id, tenant_id, name, entitlements JSONB

- entitlements
  - id, resource_type, resource_id, permissions JSONB

- policies
  - id, tenant_id, name, language, source TEXT (Rego), version, metadata

- sessions
  - id, subject_id, issued_at, expires_at, device_info JSONB

- audits
  - id (signed), tenant_id, actor, action, payload JSONB, ts

- connectors
  - id, tenant_id, type, config JSONB, last_sync, status

- certifications
  - id, tenant_id, scope JSONB, owner, schedule, results JSONB

- webhooks
  - id, tenant_id, url, secret, events []string, active bool

- branding
  - tenant_id, logo_url, colors JSONB, css text, settings JSONB

- federated_identities
  - id, identity_id, provider_id, external_id, profile JSONB

Use a migration tool (golang-migrate / Atlas / Flyway) and keep schema definitions in repo.

---

## 6. API design & contracts

Use OpenAPI for management/API endpoints and standard metadata for auth.

Key endpoints (examples):

- Auth endpoints (OIDC):
  - `GET /oauth2/authorize`
  - `POST /oauth2/token` (grant types: authorization_code, refresh_token, client_credentials)
  - `POST /oauth2/introspect`
  - `POST /oauth2/revoke`

- User management:
  - `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/users`
  - `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/users`
  - `PATCH /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/users/{uid}`

- SCIM endpoints:
  - `GET /scim/v2/Users`
  - `POST /scim/v2/Users`
  - `PATCH /scim/v2/Users/{id}`

- Policy management:
  - `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/policies`
  - `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/policies/test` (simulate)

- Governance (certifications):
  - `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/certifications`
  - `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/access-requests`
- Governance (OAuth clients – new admin API backed by govsvc):
  - `GET /api/v1/oauth/clients`
  - `POST /api/v1/oauth/clients`
  - `GET /api/v1/oauth/clients/{clientId}`
  - `PUT /api/v1/oauth/clients/{clientId}`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/oauth/clients/{clientId}`

Authentication for management APIs: OAuth2 client credentials or mTLS for internal services.

Design notes:

- Use resource-based RBAC and scopes.
- Provide API pagination and filtering.
- Provide SDKs (Go, TS, Java) generated from OpenAPI.
- Require `X-Tenant-ID` header on governance endpoints to scope all OAuth client operations; reject missing headers with `400`.

### 6.a Governance OAuth client administration (delivered)

Governance service now exposes tenant-scoped CRUD endpoints for OAuth clients so platform admins no longer touch the database directly.

#### Headers & auth

- `X-Tenant-ID` — required on every request; identifies the tenant whose clients you are managing.
- Authorization: bearer token issued via client credentials with the `governance.clients.*` scopes (or mTLS for internal calls).

#### Schemas

- Request/response bodies match the OpenAPI definitions in `api/openapi.yaml` (`OAuthClient`, `CreateOAuthClientRequest`, `UpdateOAuthClientRequest`).
- `client_type` supports `public` and `confidential`. Confidential clients must include `client_secret` on create/update; secrets are hashed server-side and never returned.

#### Sample create request

```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/clients HTTP/1.1
Host: govsvc.internal
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tenant-ID: acme-prod

{
  "client_id": "admin-portal",
  "name": "Admin Portal",
  "client_type": "confidential",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://admin.example.com/callback"],
  "allowed_scopes": ["openid", "profile"],
  "client_secret": "replace-me"
}
```

#### Success response

```json
{
  "client_id": "admin-portal",
  "tenant_id": "acme-prod",
  "client_type": "confidential",
  "name": "Admin Portal",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://admin.example.com/callback"],
  "allowed_scopes": ["openid", "profile"]
}
```

#### Error semantics

- `400` — validation error (`{"error": "client_secret is required for confidential clients"}`)
- `404` — tenant-scoped client not found (GET/PUT/DELETE)
- `409` — (future) duplicate `client_id` per tenant; currently surfaced as `400`
- `500` — unexpected server/database issues

#### Tooling

- `cmd/admincli` provides a lightweight CLI: `go run ./cmd/admincli list -tenant 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` or `create` with flags for redirects/scopes/secret. Use this until the Admin UI wires the same APIs.

---

## 7. Authentication flows

- Web / SPA: Authorization Code + PKCE
- Server-to-server: Client Credentials
- Native devices: Device Code flow
- Legacy SSO: SAML IdP connectors
- Passwordless: WebAuthn / FIDO2
- MFA types: TOTP, SMS (fallback), Push (mobile), WebAuthn

Token strategy:

- Short-lived access tokens (JWT or opaque) + refresh tokens
- Refresh token rotation and revocation
- Introspection endpoint for resource servers
- Revocation propagation via pub/sub and invalidation caches (Redis)

---

## 8. Provisioning & connectors

Connector model & lifecycle:

- Connector spec: supports `sync`, `push`, `provision` operations
- Register connector → configure → test connection → run initial sync

Sync modes:

- Full sync (initial) and incremental/delta sync (most common)
- Push-based webhooks where supported

Reconciliation & error handling:

- Reconcile rules and mapping templates
- Dead-letter queue for failed records; admin retry
- Idempotent operations and change logs

Suggested connectors to ship:

- Active Directory / LDAP
- Azure AD (Graph API)
- Google Workspace
- Workday / BambooHR (HR systems)
- Salesforce / Slack / Office365

---

## 9. Identity governance features (IGA)

- Access requests: request → approver routing → automated provisioning
- Certifications/attestations: scheduled and event-driven campaigns
- Role mining: discovery of common entitlement sets and suggested roles
- Entitlement analytics: orphaned accounts, stale access, risky entitlements
- Automated remediation: policy-driven or manual workflow

UX features:

- Email-driven approvals, bulk certification UI, attestation evidence export
- Simulation mode to preview certification impact

---

## 10. Policy & authorization

- Policy language: Rego (OPA) recommended for expressiveness and adoption
- PDP/PEP architecture: central PDP + PEP sidecars for low-latency checks
- Policy lifecycle: author → test → stage → publish → rollback
- Policy testing sandbox with unit tests and historical simulation

Caching strategy:

- Cache evaluated decisions in Redis for hot-paths; invalidate on policy change

---

## 11. Security & hardening

- Key management: KMS (cloud) + HSM for token signing keys in prod
- TLS everywhere; mTLS internal
- Secrets: HashiCorp Vault or cloud secrets manager (no secrets in repo)
- Supply chain: signed images, SBOM, dependency scanning, CI gating
- RBAC & least privilege for operators and tenant admins
- Logging: redact PII, structured logs, immutable audit trail (signed or WORM)

---

## 11.a. Zero Trust Principles

This platform is architected on a Zero Trust model, which assumes no implicit trust and continually validates every access attempt.

- **Identity as the Foundation:** Every user, device, and workload is a distinct identity.
- **Strong Authentication:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a baseline. All authentication events are logged and auditable.
- **Continuous Authorization:** Access is granted based on dynamic policies that evaluate identity, device health, location, and other real-time signals. Every request is re-authorized.
- **Device Posture:** Integrate device health and compliance checks into access policies. Unmanaged or unhealthy devices may be blocked or granted limited access.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Grant the minimum required access for a given context and timeframe.
- **Micro-segmentation:** Isolate services and data, and control traffic between them based on identity and policy.

---

## 12. Multi-tenancy & isolation

Tenancy models:

- Shared schema (tenant_id) — fast to implement
- Per-tenant schema — moderate isolation
- Per-tenant DB — maximum isolation (higher ops cost)

Recommendations:

- Start with shared schema + row-level security (RLS) and strong tenant scoping.
- Offer per-tenant schema/DB for enterprise/regulated customers.

Tenant isolation features:

- Per-tenant rate limiting, quotas, storage policies
- Data residency by region (deploy tenant data in selected region)

---

## 13. Observability & SRE

Metrics (Prometheus):

- Auth RPS, token latencies (p50/p95/p99), DB latency, connector job durations, job queue depth

Tracing (OpenTelemetry → Jaeger):

- Trace auth flows, SCIM syncs, policy evaluations

Logs: structured JSON with correlation IDs; ship to Loki/ELK; export to SIEM

Dashboards & alerts:

- Health overview, per-tenant metrics, security anomalies
- Alerts: high error rate, latency spikes, connector failures

SLOs & incident response:

- Define SLOs and error budgets; prepare runbooks and on-call rotation

---

## 14. CI/CD, infra & deployment

- IaC: Terraform for cloud infra (VPC, EKS, RDS), Helm charts for k8s apps
- CI pipeline: build → static checks → unit tests → integration tests → docker image build → image scan → push
- CD: GitOps with ArgoCD/Flux (deploy from Helm chart repo)
- Environments: local → dev → staging → prod (staging mirrors prod infra)
- Deployment strategies: canary or blue/green for safe rollouts
- Secrets injection: ExternalSecrets or Vault Agent for k8s

---

## 15. Backup, DR & lifecycle

- DB backups: periodic snapshots + point-in-time recovery where available
- Log lifecycle: hot store in Loki/ELK + cold archive to S3 with lifecycle rules
- Disaster recovery: documented failover steps; automatic replication where applicable
- Data retention & deletion APIs (GDPR-compliant)

---

## 16. Testing strategy

- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for flows: OIDC, SAML, SCIM, policy eval
- Contract tests for connector APIs (Pact or similar)
- Performance tests: token issuance RPS, introspection latency
- Security checks: SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, pentests
- Chaos testing: DB failovers, network partitions, worker restarts

---

## 17. Deployment & scaling concerns

- Stateless services scale horizontally (auth, API)
- Stateful services: Postgres scaling (read-replicas or sharding), connector workers scale by queue depth
- Token caches at the edge to reduce latency (with invalidation)
- Rate limiting per-tenant + per-client to protect the system

---

## 18. UX & Developer experience

Admin UX:

- Dashboard, user/group/role management, certification management

Developer portal:

- OpenAPI docs, client SDKs, quickstart, sample apps, and test sandbox

Local dev experience:

- docker-compose for local stacks, scripts to bootstrap a test tenant

---

## 19. Compliance & audit

- Immutable audit trails with signed IDs; export to SIEM
- Evidence automation for certifications and access requests
- Built-in reports for GDPR data exports and deletions
- Gap analysis and artifacts to support SOC2/ISO compliance efforts

---

## 20. Cost & business model

- Cost drivers: infra (DB, k8s nodes), connectors maintenance, storage for logs
- Pricing levers: active users, authentications per month, connectors used, storage
- Offer freemium: basic SSO free; advanced governance & connectors paid

---

## 21. Roadmap & milestones

- Week 0: Product spec, team, stack
- Weeks 1–4 (MVP): OIDC server, user store, admin API, basic SCIM connector, simple admin UI
- Weeks 5–12: SAML, policy engine, certifications, role mining, additional connectors
- Months 3–6: scalability, compliance readiness, enterprise-grade features

---

## 22. Risks & mitigations

- Complexity of auth: reuse proven libraries (go-oidc, or run Keycloak/Dex as reference)
- Connector upkeep cost: provide SDK and marketplace for community connectors
- Security breaches: continuous security reviews; rotate keys; blinding sensitive logs
- Scale surprises: benchmark early and design sharding patterns

---

## 23. Runbooks & operational checklists

Create runbooks for:

- Token service outage
- Connector sync failure
- DB failover & restore
- Breach response and rotation of keys

Each runbook should include: detection steps (alerts/metrics), mitigation steps, recovery verification, and post-mortem template.

---

## 24. Deliverables & artifacts to produce early

- Product one-pager + success metrics
- OpenAPI spec for management APIs
- OIDC test client app
- Connector SDK spec + example connector
- Admin UI wireframes
- Policy repo template (Rego) with sample policies
- CI/CD templates & Helm skeletons

---

## 25. Appendix — snippets & examples

### Sample OpenAPI stub (Users & Auth)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Identity Management API
  version: 0.1.0
paths:
  /api/v1/tenants/{tid}/users:
    get:
      summary: List users for tenant
      parameters:
        - name: tid
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success
```

### Sample Rego policy (illustrative)

```rego
package authz

default allow = false

allow {
  input.action == "access"
  some i
  input.subject.roles[i] == "admin"
}

allow {
  input.action == "access"
  input.subject.attributes.department == "security"
}
```

### SCIM mapping example

- SCIM `userName` -> `accounts.login`
- SCIM `emails[0].value` -> `identities.attributes.email`
- SCIM `externalId` -> `identity.external_source_id`

### Token revocation pattern

- Maintain revocation list in Redis with TTL equal to token expiry for quick checks
- Persist revoked refresh tokens in Postgres for audit
- Publish revocation events to edge caches via message bus
